# InstagramClone

In this project, I used cocoapods to include firebase in the project, and I did firebase operations such as saving-editing the data and pulling the loaded data, and the instagram clone application appeared.

<h1>Some of the features I learned:</h1>
<p>-Tab Bar</p>
<p>-Sign Up and Sign In to the Firebase (Auth)</p>
<p>-Adding data to the Firebase Store and Database</p>
<p>-Creating custom cell (prototype cell) to the tableView</p>
<p>-Pulling data from Firebase</p>
<p>-Data order</p>
<p>-Some functions (instagram like posts, adding photo in the phone lib etc).</p>
<p>Logout FireBase and App</p>
<p>Open Feeds directly once the user is Sign in to the app</p>
